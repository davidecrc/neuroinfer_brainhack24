# neuroinfer_brainhack24

NeuroInfer (NI) is a meta-analitical tool developed during BrainHack Lucca 2023 to support neuroscientists' inference on fMRI data. 

NI implements a Bayesian approach and it is currently based on a dataset of more than 14,000 fMRI studies (shared with NeuroSynth). 

This repository contains the results of the project proposed during BrainHack Lucca 2024, aiming at updating the database of NI.
