# neuroinfer_brainhack24

NeuroInfer (NI) is a meta-analitical tool developed during BrainHack Lucca 2023 (https://github.com/davidecrc/neuroinfer_brainhack23) to support neuroscientists' inference on fMRI data. 

NI implements a Bayesian approach and it is currently based on a dataset of more than 14,000 fMRI studies (shared with NeuroSynth). 

This repository contains the results of the project proposed during BrainHack Lucca 2024, aiming at updating the database of NI.


Goals of the BrainHack Lucca 2024 project:

1. Check the current version of the NeuroInfer software
3. Definition of the main steps for processing fMRI studies full-texts
4. Pipeline development
5. Implementation and test of different pipelines 
6. Final assessment
